  "content": "My name is Megan Corletti. I attend Allegheny College and am in the graduating class of 2021. I never intended to take Education Studies class when I came to college. When I realized I needed a second minor, it was the first one that came to my mind. I knew of friends who were taking some classes and it seemed like the easiest choice. And in the back of my mind, I knew it was a topic I was going to be intertested in since being a teacher would always be something I could have a passion in. Through my 3 years of education classes, I have learned more than I could have imagined about being a better teacher (to students or colleugues) as well as about the issues that have happened and are happening in the field for fellow teachers and students. While teaching is not the job I will have right out of college, I plan to take these tactics and use them when helping out colleugues in the field. However, someday, I could see myself teaching and I hope to carry on the lessons I have learned in here in the Allegheny College Education Studies program."
