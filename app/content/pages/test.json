  "content": "One of the first topics discussed in Education 100 at Allegheny is 'Educational Philosphy'. Someone's educational philosophy is self-reflective statement of your beliefs about teaching and learning. Every student is instructed to think and describe what they believe to be their educational philosphy. Over time in the education department, students will have the opportunity to realize that their educational philosophy has changed. Whether it be because of the classes they have taken or the people they have met. Sophomore year, it was clear that my philosphy was focused on removing grades and focusing on the process of education rather than the end goal. Specifically, I wrote in my philosphy paper in EDU 100 'My educational philosophy will focus on the process of learning, the incorporation of positivity from teacher to student and vice versa, and the negation of grades'. Looking back to this quote, my philosophy on grade negation and the educational process has not gone away. But rather, it has formed into an idea that is less broad and more specific, on implementations and strategies. Fast forward to senior year and I am taking EDU 543, the educational internship. Our final project is focused around educational philosophies and combining everyone's into one solid curriculum plan. My implementations focused on visualization, points systems, and games. Visualization have became a primary focus on my educational philosphy due to a class I took as well as my experience tutoring. It is important to have benefits for all students especially those that are English Language learners or even students that may have trouble grasping the concept, just from lecture. Point systems (or just rewards) is the replacement of grades. It is a point system to reward completion of a task rather than the right or wrong answer. The point system plays into affect with games. Games become the new delivery method of the curriculum. They allow students to default to a more playful atmosphere where they can be more relaxed and retain the information being taught. More on this topic can be seem under my blog section titled 'Gator Aid'. ",
