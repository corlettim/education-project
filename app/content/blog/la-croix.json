  "content": "Gator Aid is an unplugged (i.e. computerless) interactive curriculum for teaching college-level introductory computer science that takes the form of a physical game. Responding to students dependencies on the computer holding the secret to what makes their code work. It is time to unplug from the computer and let students see that it comes down to their computational abilities that allow for the code to compile and build. The basis of this research focuses on 'unplugged' activities that adapt gamification. Most 'unplugged' activities have been attempted with students that are K-12, in other subjects; there has been a lack of research done on computer science gamification on the surface level. In the case of Gator Aid, the curriculum will take on the challenge of achieving the high-level teaching strategies through interactive games needed for college introductory computer science classes. Each concept will have its own game to allow the students to focus primarily on the task/game at hand. I never expected to combine my minor into my Senior Thesis comp especially since my comp is for computer science.  However, I found myself drawn to changing the curriculum and stereotype of how one is to learn computer science. Even though, it was different from classes I have taken, it was important to understand the foundations of how students work in classrooms and not be bias for how a topic should be discussed. This project let me understand and connect with Bloom's Taxonomy a bit more and create a curriculum that hit markers for all students to relate to. It opens the field of computer science to students who may consider themselves not eligible due to mental capabilities.",
