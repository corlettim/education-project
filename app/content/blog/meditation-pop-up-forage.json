  "content": "Even though Education classes at Allegheny are focused on in school teaching with students, education is needed in other professions as well. For instance, in my new upcoming job, as a software engineer, one might think that there is no education point of view that will come from my side of things. However, specifically I will have to learn, but there is a chance I will have to teach my fellow TDPs tasks that maybe they do not know. Not to mention, that at some point I will be a senior developer and thus, have the responsibility to teach the junior developers how to go about completing their job effectively and efficiently. The strategies I have learned through my education classes will help when teaching and learning in my new career. Furthermore, it will be one of the first times I will be learning outside of the classroom and therefore, must adapt to the new learning world around me.",
